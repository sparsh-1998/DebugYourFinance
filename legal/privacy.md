# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

At DebugYourFinance ("we", "our", or "us"), we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle data when you use our website and financial calculators.

## Our Privacy-First Approach

**We Don't Collect Personal Data.**
DebugYourFinance is built with privacy as a fundamental principle. We do NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal information or financial data entered into our calculators.

## Data Processing

### Client-Side Only
- All calculations are performed entirely in your web browser
- No financial data is sent to our servers
- No calculation results are stored on our systems
- Your data never leaves your device

### Local Storage
We use browser local storage only to:
- Remember your calculator preferences (e.g., last entered values)
- Store your dark/light mode theme preference
- Enhance your user experience across sessions

**You can clear this data anytime** by clearing your browser's local storage or using incognito/private browsing mode.

## Third-Party Services
